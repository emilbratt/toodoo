## [TooDoo](https://emilbratt.github.io/toodoo/)

Writing a todo application using vanilla JavaScript, for learning and for my own usecase.

The goal is to make an easy-to-use todo app that looks (somewhat) nice and feels snappy.

The web app has no login; it is just your browser, your local data and yourself.
